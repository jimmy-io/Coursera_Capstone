        "Frank Lloyd Wright said it best - â€œTip the world over on its side and everything loose will land in Los Angeles.\" For decades people from all over the world have come to this city in search of home, family, love, fame, and fortune. Los Angeles welcomes this multicultural migration with a suburban sprawl that encompases over 88 cities, and even more unincorporated neihborhoods. Each of these neighborhoods are characterized by geographical, economic, and cultural features that make them uniquely poised to cater to different demographics.\n",
        "Neighborhoods like Downtown Los Angeles, Culver City, Long Beach, Century City, and West Hollywood provide a mixture of urban style living and accessibility to grocery stores, malls, means of public transportation and entertainment venues within walking distance. On the otherhand suburbs like Baldwin Hills, Crenshaw, Echo Park and Boyle Heights are quiter neighborhoods with single family dwellings that are not easily accessible via public modes of transportation.\n",
        "Given the vast spectrum of possibilites of neighborhoods to choose from in LA, someone looking to move here might be overwhelmed. In this project I've attempted to characterize neighborhoods in LA by the nature of venue that are in their immediate vicinities using a clustering algorithm. Results from this analysis show that neighborhoods in LA fall under a few groups, defined by the nature of the venues closest to them. This is of most interest to rental unit searching apps like Westiside Rentals or Rentpad, to real estate agents, and generally, to people looking to move to LA. The results of this project can help them find neighborhoods that are most aligned with what they are looking for in a place to live and overall, provide a more satisfactory experience than chosing a neighborhood at random."

        "The venues in the vicinity of these neighborhoods will be retreived using the FourSquare API search engine. Venues of five different categories were chosen: Travel & Transport, Arts & Entertainment, Outdoors & Recreation, Nightlife Spot, and Food. The number of venues of each category for each neighborhood was counted and then normalized to give five parameters with which to cluster the neighborhoods by."
